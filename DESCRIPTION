Description: The think tank '2DII' (2 Degrees Investing
    Initiative; <https://2degrees-investing.org/>) maintains a set of
    packages designed for banks. Together, those packages implement in R a
    methodology known as 'PACTA' (Paris Agreement Capital Transition
    Assessment), which enables users to measure the alignment of financial
    portfolios with climate goals. This package makes it easy to install
    and load all '2DII' packages for banks in a single step.
