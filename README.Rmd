The think tank '2DII' (2 Degrees Investing
Initiative; <https://2degrees-investing.org/>) maintains a set of
packages designed for banks. Together, those packages implement in R a
methodology known as 'PACTA' (Paris Agreement Capital Transition
Assessment), which enables users to measure the alignment of financial
portfolios with climate goals. This package makes it easy to install
and load all '2DII' packages for banks in a single step.
